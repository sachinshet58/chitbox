# Requirements Analysis

The Requirements Analysis stage is the first step in the process of developing and deploying a web application on a real-time server. In this stage, the project requirements are understood and documented. This involves identifying the needs of the users, the system, and the business, and translating these needs into technical requirements that can guide the subsequent stages of the project.
