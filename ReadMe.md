### Explanation of Each Stage:

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Understand and document the project requirements.
2. **Design Phase:** 
   - **Architecture Design:** Plan the overall system architecture.
   - **Database Schema Design:** Design the database structure.
   - **UI Design:** Design the user interface.
   - **API Design:** Design the application programming interfaces.
3. **Development Phase:** 
   - **Frontend Development:** Develop the client-side application.
   - **Backend Development:** Develop the server-side application.
   - **Database Implementation:** Set up the database.
   - **API Implementation:** Develop the APIs.
4. **Testing Phase:** 
   - **Unit Testing:** Test individual components.
   - **Integration Testing:** Test integration between components.
   - **Performance Testing:** Test the performance of the application.
   - **Security Testing:** Test for vulnerabilities.
5. **Deployment Phase:** 
   - **Staging Deployment:** Deploy in a staging environment.
   - **Production Deployment:** Deploy in the production environment.
   - **Real-Time Server Deployment:** Deploy the real-time server components.
6. **Maintenance and Monitoring:** 
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor the system continuously.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize for better performance.
   - **Regular Updates and Patches:** Apply updates and patches.
   - **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Implement backup and disaster recovery plans.
